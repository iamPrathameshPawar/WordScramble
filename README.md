Wordscramble app :


Features and Steps : 
1. Gives us one word from the 12000 saved words in the .text file in project. 
2. We have to make the new words from the letters of the given word, hence the name word scramble 
3. If you make the in-valid or un-original or un-real word, then that will flagged with Alert and won't be added into the list. This functionality has been implemented to make the game more sturdy and fair.
